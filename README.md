# OpRemover
This plugin is made to keep Minecraft servers more secure. There is always the possibility that the account of some administrator or staff member ends up hacked or something like that, that can put a server at risk. This plugin removes a player's operator status after it leaves the server so that if the account ends up being hacked, they can't do anything with the operator status or anything like that.
## How to Install​

* Drag and drop it on your plugins folder.
* Restart your server.
* Done!
## How to use​
* Open the plugin folder
* Open the config.yml
* Edit the _PlayerName_ and change it for the Op Players you want to remove the Op after leaving the server.
* Go to the game and run the command _/opremover reload_ to reload the config.yml file
* Done!

* There's also other options like _/oprecovery password_ which is made to recover operator status, or in the config gamemode change on quit.
